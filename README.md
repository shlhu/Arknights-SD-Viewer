# Shlhu's First Note (JAN 15 2023)
To enable testing the site locally, jekyll was site was setup. To keep the components a bit cleaner, I moved the site related code/assests to it's own directory and so it's kept separate from the scripts.

To setup jekyll to start testing yourself:
1. Setup ruby, bundle, and jekyll per instructions at the top here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site
2. cd into site/
3. run `bundle install`
4. run `bundle add webrick`
5. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You should get a link locally that shows the site.

# IMPORTANT NOTE (JAN 15 2023)

According to this issue here: https://github.com/Aceship/AN-EN-Tags/issues/147, at some point something may have changed with the chibis from the game files which causes the SD viewer to not work with them.  What's the change?  What's the problem?  I couldn't tell you.  This affects everything released after Goldenglow.  Since I don't know the issue I can't update this anymore until whatever that issue is is fixed.  Even then if the chibi viewer changes dramatically on Aceship then I may not be able to fix this on here either (I did not write this originally I just added missing chibis).

# Arknights SD Viewer (Sparen Fork)

This is SparenofIr√≠a's fork of the Arknights SD Viewer repo. The main purpose of this fork is to provide animations for projects such as ArknightsDNH. There is no expectation of parity with the original repository. Parity additions will remain on the main gh-pages branch while all other changes will go in the sparen-dev branch.

Original Repo: https://github.com/alg-wiki/Arknights-SD-Viewer

Original Live Website: https://arknights.nuke.moe

## Getting New Assets
Latest Arknights CN APK: https://ak.hypergryph.com/downloads/android_lastest

1. Download CN APK (NA/JP APK will not work since they do not have assets in the APK); rename .apk to .zip
2. Navigate to `assets/AB/Android/charpack` for chibi sprites
3. Asset Studio GUI - Load it, export it in the same directory as the .ab files. Export Options should have grouping done by `type name` to be compatible with the Python scripts used for processing.
4. Run sort.py inside a directory called `charpack` with the Texture2D and TextAsset outputs from Asset Studio

Caveats:

- CN APK still does not include skins
- sort.py should only ever be run on the full dataset once, since pretty much all the data in the JSON (e.g. class, rarity) needs to be repopulated from scratch. For adding new characters once the existing portion is established, you can still run sort.py in order to organize the files, but charData.js and enemyData.js should be edited manually and should not use the automatically generated output from sort.py.

Portraits:

- Portraits are located at `assets/AB/Android/spritepack` at ui_char_avatar_h1_0.ab, ui_char_avatar_h1_elite_0.ab, and ui_char_avatar_h1_skins_0.ab. These require masks to be applied manually (e.g. texmapalpha.py). Note that portraits are 180x180, but the masks and atlases ARE NOT 180x180 for whatever reason. The recommended approach is to find the extra pixels and manually crop the portraits.

Removing .prefab extension on skel and atlas files:

`find . -type f -name "*.atlas.prefab" -exec rename 's/\.atlas.prefab$/.atlas/' '{}' \;`

`find . -type f -name "*.skel.prefab" -exec rename 's/\.skel.prefab$/.skel/' '{}' \;`

## SOP - Adding a new Character
- Process the charpack chibi sprite and add the front, back, and base png, skel, and atlas files
- Given the name of the character, add them with their information manually into charData.js
- Process the portraits and add their E1 and E2 portraits (or skin, if applicable)
- Perform the same for their summons, if any
- Verify that all animations are functional!

## Python Scripts
The original repository contains three top level python scripts - alpha.py, enemy.py, and sort.py. These were not documented in the original repository. This section documents their usage.

For processing character data, sort.py is used, while for enemy data, enemy.py is used. Regardless, image data needs to go through alpha.py (to apply masks).

### alpha.py
This script applies alpha masks onto the output of sort.py, generating transparent images.

### enemy.py
This script is used on the raw Asset Studio ENEMY exports to neatly organize them, as well as create the enemyData file.

### sort.py
This script is used on the raw Asset Studio CHARACTER exports to process all sprite assets and neatly organize them, as well as create the charData file. The original script assumes the following:

- Extraction was done in-place with the extracted Texture2D and TextAsset directories in the *same directory as the .ab* originals. The filename of the .ab files, excluding the .ab portions cut off using `[:-3]`, are the IDs used for filepaths everywhere else in the system. 

The new script assumes the following, in addition:

- front, back, and base directories have been prepared
- You have a way to remove the .prefab extension from all skel and atlas files

### scraper.py
This script was written in order to scrape the existing character data files from https://media.nuke.moe so that everything could be referenced locally. 

It is run as follows:

`python3 scraper.py targetchar enemyflag<Y/N> nodormflag<Y/N> nobackflag<Y/N> `

`targetchar` is the skin name for the character. `enemyflag` should be set to 'Y' iff the script is being run for an enemy rather than an operator. `nodormflag` should be set to 'Y' if there is no dorm animation (e.g. Weedy's cannon), and `nobackflag` should be set to 'Y' if there is no dorm or back flag (e.g. W's mines). All flags are optional, but the names are required in order for the script to work at all.

### texmapalpha.py
This script applies a mask onto an image. It is primarily used for portrait extraction
